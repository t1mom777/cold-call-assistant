<h1>Cold Call Assistant</h1>
Cold Call Assistant is an open-source application developed using the Frappe Framework, Twilio API, OpenAI's GPT-3 API, Whisper API, and Google Text-to-Speech API. The application automates the process of cold calling potential leads and guiding them through a scripted conversation to generate pre-set targets, such as obtaining email details or scheduling an appointment. The results of each cold call are displayed within the application, and any targets generated during the conversation are highlighted in the interface.
